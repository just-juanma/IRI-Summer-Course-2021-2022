Read carefully the definition of Pointers (https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/) and review some Math.h functions (https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/). Use the acquired knowledge to pass this test.
Develop a software that receives an array size and an array with lengths, with this data classify the shape (Circle, Square/Rectangle or Triangle/Rectangle), and report the Area and Perimeter.
Implement the following functions void TraversingArray, int Perimeter, int Area, char* TypeFigure, which receive.
	1. Information
	- int sidesQuantity
