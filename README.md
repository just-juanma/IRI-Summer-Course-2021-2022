In the folder of each exercise, you will find the statement in English and Spanish. The solution of each problem is only in English.

If you want Spanish solutions, you can found me under the name "juanmanuelgonza1" on every Hackerrank leaderboard.

## ⬇️ How to Install and Run the Project <a name="howto"></a>

Since they are exercises to be run in HackerRank, they are not easily debuggable/compileable unless HackerRank is used.

## ⚠️ Considerations <a name="considerations"></a>

I repeat: it is not easily debuggable in any IDE, if not in HackerRank. The site is prepared to receive testing in spanish, so in English you will not pass practically any exercise. There are still unfinished translations
